# CRISP-DM-project

Our project focuses on customer review summarization for TechExpress, online marketplace of digital equipment and electronics, using Data Mining techniques. In the project, we aim to extract key aspects and sentiments from online reviews, enabling users to quickly understand the overall consensus and sentiments surrounding a product or service. Following the CRISP-DM methodology, our goals include exploring the relevent data, developing approaches to estimate the quality, relevance, and objectivity of generated summaries, creating a model for generating meaningful reviews, and identifying key trends in customer feedback. 

## Dataset
We collected a dataset, which includes customer reviews for electronics & digital products from Amazon.com. Specifically, Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset, which includes Amazon US Reviews Electronics [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitsharma527/amazon-reviews-us-electronics) and additional Amazon US Reviews Camera, Mobile Electronics, PC, Software, and Wireless [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cynthiarempel/amazon-us-customer-reviews-dataset).
